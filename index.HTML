    <p>My full name is Osborne Calvin Jackson I was born in Gulfport,Mississppi 20 years ago</p>
    <p>Moved around a couple states for my moms job lived in Amarilo,Texas when I was 11</p>
    <p>lived there for a year then moved to Scottsdale,Arizona and stayed there for five years</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Graduated at a online charter school called Student Choice then moved back to Gulfport</p>
    <p>planing to  go to college then My mother was preahing to me to get a trade job skill like</p>
    <p>being a mechanic or a HVAC technician and MGCC had many programs I was intrested in</p>
    <p>Then that week that I was going to call MGCC my mom found mississppi coding acadey</p>
    <p>on facebook so that really peak my intrest more then being a mechanic and HVAC technician</p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Now mind you never had coding expericence before this barely new what really coding was </p>
    <p>I had base level knowledge of coding but I knew its how compaines made video games so then </p>
    <p>that really peaked my intrest and to be able to tell others you code makes everyone think youre super smart</p>
    <p>So yeah thats kind of how I got into coding call them that week set up an interview and havent looked back since</p>


    <h3 class=" Goals" ; style=" font-size:200%;">What I plan on accomplishing from coding</h3>

    <p class=" Goals">And coding is a good market to get in its always expanding I think it is a neccessity skill to learn also</p>
    <p class=" Goals">to conclude this I guess what Im trying to do with coding is just being as skillful as I can and getting into a good job</p>
